"""Client-facing MCP tool descriptions.

Style rule for every description:
- Start with "Use when" so non-coding clients can choose tools by intent.
- Prefer domain words a kit user sees in Cruxible: config, query, receipt,
  workflow, review, group, state, source evidence.
- Avoid implementation terms that are not useful for tool choice.
